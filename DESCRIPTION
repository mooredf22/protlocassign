Description: This package uses a constrained proportional assignment (CPA)
   model to to estimate the distribution of proteins among 
   different subcellular locations based of analytical 
   subcellular fractionation data.
    The package includes 
    improve the accuracy of the assignments as well as
    functions for simulating mixtures and evaluating 
    the performance of CPA on those mixtures.
    Also included are functions for summarizing spectral-level 
    data using random effects models to calculate average protein profiles.
